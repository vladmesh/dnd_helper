## Backend overview

This document tracks backend-related notes and the immediate backlog. Keep documentation concise and actionable.

### Stack (brief)
- Python 3.11, FastAPI (service: `api`)
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Alembic for migrations
- Docker Compose for local/dev

### Current API (high level)
- Monsters: `GET /monsters`, `GET /monsters/{id}`, `GET /monsters/search?q=...`
- Spells: `GET /spells`, `GET /spells/{id}`, `GET /spells/search?q=...`

## Backlog

### 1) Search flow should return to main menu (not Bestiary/Spells) [DONE]
- Scope: Bot UX primarily. Backend is already returning search results.
- Goal: After showing search results for monsters/spells, the navigation button should bring user back to Main Menu instead of feature roots.
- Acceptance:
  - Search results keyboard contains a "To main menu" button; pressing it shows the main reply keyboard
  - No backend changes required unless additional metadata is needed (N/A for now)

### 2) Unified logging configuration [DONE]
- Goal: Consistent, structured logs across all services.
- Scope: `api`, `bot`.
- Proposal:
  - Define a shared logging format and fields (service, level, timestamp, message, request_id/correlation_id).
  - Choose output: JSON lines by default; human-readable format for local dev optional.
  - Store a reusable template (e.g., `logging_config.py` or `logging.yaml`) in a shared location and import/use it in each service.
  - Ensure configuration via env vars (level, JSON toggle).
- Acceptance:
  - Both services emit logs with identical structure and fields.
  - Service name is present; timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC.
  - Log level and JSON toggle controllable via environment variables.

### 3) Arbitrary dice roll generation [DONE]
- Goal: Allow generating arbitrary dice expressions (e.g. `2d6+1`, `d20-2`, `3d8+2d4+5`).
- Proposal (backend): Add endpoint `GET /dice?expr=<expression>` that
  - validates safe expressions in a limited grammar: `(<term> ("+"|"-") <term>)*`, where `<term>` is either `NdM` or integer constant
  - supports `N >= 1`, `M in {2,3,4,6,8,10,12,20,100}`; caps `N` and total terms for safety
  - response payload includes: parsed terms, individual rolls per `NdM`, total, normalized expression
- Acceptance:
  - Given `expr=2d6+1` â†’ returns two d6 rolls, modifier 1, correct total
  - Invalid expr returns `422` with error details
  - Implemented as a simple bot-only flow (no API endpoint)

### 4) Test coverage (endpoints at minimum) [DONE]
- Goal: Solid tests for API routers (smoke + behavior).
- Scope: `api` service.
- Minimum test matrix:
  - Monsters: list, detail (valid/404), search (hit/miss)
  - Spells: list, detail (valid/404), search (hit/miss)
  - If dice endpoint is added: valid expressions, validation errors, caps
- Tooling: `pytest`, `httpx.AsyncClient`, seed fixtures as needed
- Acceptance: CI runs tests green; meaningful assertions beyond 200 OK

### 5) Linters/formatters
- Goal: Consistent style and static checks across services.
- Proposal:
  - Ruff for linting (pyproject-managed), Black for formatting, isort for imports
  - Optional: mypy (incremental adoption), pre-commit hooks
- Acceptance:
  - Commands succeed locally and in CI
  - No outstanding linter violations in `api` (and preferably `bot`)

### 6) Bot test coverage
- Goal: Automated tests for the Telegram bot covering key handlers and flows.
- Scope: `bot` service.
- Areas:
  - Smoke: app wiring and basic startup invariants
  - Handlers: dice flow, search flow (monsters/spells), main menu callbacks
  - Keyboards: callback data formats and pagination helpers
  - API client repository: basic success/error handling with mocked API
- Tooling: `pytest`, PTB test utilities/mocks, `httpx` mocking
- Acceptance:
  - Tests validate handler behavior (callbacks, messages sent, state changes)
  - No external network calls; API interactions mocked
  - Tests run green via `bot/docker_compose_tests.yml`

## Notes
- Keep endpoints minimal and predictable; avoid coupling bot UX to API responses unless necessary.
- For dice: implement a small, safe parser rather than `eval`; add input caps to prevent abuse.


### 7) Multilingual support (Bot UI)
- Goal: Provide RU/EN (and potentially more) language support for bot texts and keyboards.
- Scope: `bot` service (handlers, keyboards, messages). API remains language-agnostic for now.
- Acceptance:
  - Language can be switched (command or settings submenu), and persists per user.
  - All current bot flows render localized texts consistently (menus, lists, details, errors).

### 8) Filter/search fields refinement
- Goal: Align and finalize filterable/searchable fields for Spells and Monsters across API and Bot.
- Scope: `api` review of `/spells` and `/monsters` models and derived fields; `bot` quick filters mapping.
- Acceptance:
  - Agreed field list (documented) with types, value domains, and nullability.
  - Bot quick filters map 1:1 to documented fields or derived ones; gaps identified.

### 9) Source discovery for missing DB fields
- Goal: Identify data sources to populate currently missing attributes (e.g., roles, environments, tags, range normalization).
- Scope: Research and propose ingestion/backfill strategy; do not implement ingestion yet.
- Acceptance:
  - Brief report with candidate sources, license notes, and data coverage.
  - Proposed backfill approach (one-time vs. migrations) and risks.

### 10) Tests for new filtering functionality
- Goal: Cover newly added inline filters and list rendering in Bot; extend API tests if backend filters/pagination are added later.
- Scope: `bot` tests for spells/monsters filters, pagination and state; optional `api` when Iteration 3 backend is implemented.
- Acceptance:
  - Bot tests validate toggles, Apply/Reset, pagination over filtered sets.
  - Tests run green via `bot/docker_compose_tests.yml`.

### 11) Linting pass
- Goal: Ensure clean lint status across updated files.
- Scope: `api`, `bot` as needed after feature changes.
- Acceptance:
  - `python manage.py lint` (ruff) passes without violations.

### 12) Remove IDs from UI display
- Goal: Stop showing internal IDs in list item labels and detail views.
- Scope: `bot` list buttons and detail messages for monsters and spells.
- Acceptance:
  - List buttons display names without `(#id)` suffix.
  - Detail views show names and content only; no internal IDs exposed.

### 13) Full-text search for localized content (RU/EN)
- Goal: Add FTS for `monster_translations` and `spell_translations` with per-language indexes.
- Scope: `api` service, PostgreSQL GIN indexes.
- Acceptance:
  - Language-specific search works with `lang` parameter.
  - Indexes exist and are used; performance verified on seed data size.

### 14) More informative error logs (500 details)
- Goal: Improve observability by including request context and exception details when HTTP 5xx errors occur.
- Scope: `api` service primarily; minor alignment in `bot` for upstream error surfaces.
- Proposal:
  - Add FastAPI exception handlers/middleware to log:
    - route, method, status code
    - correlation id (if present), user id (if available)
    - exception type, message, stacktrace
    - request payload size (not body), response time
  - Keep response bodies unchanged; do not leak internals to clients in production.
  - Gate verbose stacktraces behind env flag (e.g., `LOG_INCLUDE_TRACEBACK=true`).
- Acceptance:
  - 500 responses produce structured error logs with route/method and exception info.
  - Toggle controls verbosity via env without code changes.
  - No sensitive data (secrets, raw request bodies) in logs.

### 15) Clean up and squash Alembic migrations
- Goal: Reduce migration noise and speed up setup by squashing and cleaning obsolete revisions.
- Scope: `api` service Alembic history.
- Proposal:
  - Remove redundant/empty or superseded revisions.
  - Create a new baseline squashed revision representing current schema.
  - Preserve production safety: perform only after verifying all environments are at `head`.
- Acceptance:
  - Fresh database can be created with a minimal set of migrations (ideally one baseline + recent changes).
  - CI and local setup times improve; no functional changes to runtime schema.

### 16) Align DB schema and Alembic autogenerate (prevent spurious diffs)
- Goal: Stop Alembic autogenerate from emitting unrelated FK/constraint changes when editing unrelated columns.
- Scope: `api` service models and Alembic env.
- Proposal:
  - Ensure ORM metadata for FKs (ondelete, names) match the actual DB (migrations).
  - Stabilize constraint names (use explicit names) to avoid name-based churn.
  - Add Alembic `include_object`/render options to ignore known-noise changes if intentional.
  - Document policy: which constraints/indexes are managed in migrations only vs ORM.
- Acceptance:
  - Running `alembic revision --autogenerate` after a no-op model change yields only the intended column diffs, no FK churn.
  - FK constraints for `monster_translations` and `spell_translations` no longer flap (drop/create) without intentional change.
