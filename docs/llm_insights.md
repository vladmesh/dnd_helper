## LLM Insights & Ideas

Purpose: A single place to quickly capture out-of-scope ideas that arise during any task or brainstorming. This helps preserve focus while ensuring significant ideas are not lost.

Assistant rule:
- If an idea appears that is not directly related to the current task, immediately write it here. This includes optimizations, refactors, business logic improvements, data issues, or anything significant.
- You may update this file at any time, within any other task, without asking.
- Keep entries short and actionable using the template below.

Template for new entries:
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Context: brief context where the idea emerged
- Idea: concise description
- Why it matters: impact or risk
- Scope/Effort: S/M/L (rough estimate)
- Next step: suggested action if prioritized
- Related files/areas: list of relevant paths or modules
